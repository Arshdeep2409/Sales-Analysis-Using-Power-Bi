1. Top Performing Region:
East Zone leads in sales with approximately 0.39M in total sales.

It is followed by South, West, and North, in that order.

Insight: Focus marketing and inventory efforts more in the East zone to maintain momentum, and investigate growth opportunities in lower-performing zones like North.

It is followed by:

Furniture: 26.7% (~320.15K)

3. Monthly Sales Trends:
February shows the highest sales peak, followed by October.

Lowest sales are observed in July and September.

Insight: Sales spikes suggest possible seasonal campaigns (e.g., Valentine's in February, festive season in October). Slow months can be targeted with promotions or discount strategies.

🔹 Actionable Recommendations:
⭐ Maintain focus on high-performing zones (East) and replicate success strategies in other zones.

📦 Boost promotional efforts in underperforming categories (e.g., Stationery).

🕒 Capitalize on high-sales months (February, October) with special campaigns and align stock and staffing accordingly.

🔄 Review slow months to understand bottlenecks — consider running discounts, bundles, or new product launches then.
